# SGGC-AWS-Lambda
This is a collection of lambda functions that are used to support the Steam group game checker (SGGC). Designed to be run on AWS Lambda.

## Todo

Currently we only have one lambda but we could add more. We may want to migrate this project to a multi-module project with a common module for common code, like models and such.
